# **Lora_chan**
This is a project that I started to develop, the principal goal to reach is to build an AI interface by using a bot character created in unity to emulate an AI behavior. 
In other words, this is an interface of an AI API (probably chat gpt), emulating a waifubot.

### **4.-  Listening**
  Lora Chan can  listens to you, but the way to do it is strict, if you want to Lora chan opens any app for you, you need to say the default command 
  "Abre" + [your name application], if you want to ask or request something to Lora Chan, you gonna need to say "Lora Chan", she will be in animation like sheÂ´s listening to you
  after that, you must say whatever you want to ask or request, once you finish talking, Lora chan will wait approximately 1 or 2 seconds to stops to listening you and will think the
  answer for you, once the answer or response is already finished, Lora chan will open a text file with the response and she will red it for you

   > To make Lora Chan listens to you, click the ear button:
